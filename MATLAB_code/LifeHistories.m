%  Assigns Lif History Stages
%  Reference: 
%  Uses the following parameters:
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%This function is dependent on the weight of each fish, since weight is
%proportional to life history structure and number of stages (lifespan)...
%That's why it comes after you already created the nicheweb.
%I will build a new nicheweb for this (to determine feeding structure,
%unless Anna has a better idea), and then replace the known ones with the
%old nicheweb, so as to not mess up the entire model.  (So you are
%basically just adding rows and columns for your new life stages).

%function [output]= LifeHistories(input)
function [nicheweb_new,lifehistory_table]= LifeHistories(isfish,Mvec,nichewebsize,connectance,nicheweb)
