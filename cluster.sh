# The looping script to run on ACENET clusters.
###############################################
# ACENET (www.ace-net.ca) provides cluster computing resources for researchers at Dal (and elsewhere).
# Your thesis supervisor will have to get an account before you can, but both are free.
# The process is described in more detail at https://www.ace-net.ca/wiki/Get_an_Account.
#
# If you have never used a cluster before you will want some training.
# There are several classroom and web training sessions scheduled for early May;
# see http://www.ace-net.ca/training/workshops-seminars/ for details.
