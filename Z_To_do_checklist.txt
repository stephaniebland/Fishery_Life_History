##########LIFE STAGES IN FOOD WEBS##########
Life History Incorporation into Food Web must fit following requirements:

1. None of the lifestages are autotrophs
2. All lifestages have reasonable trophic levels
3. All lifestages must be connected to basal species (for consistency) 
4. Do we care if there are disconnected webs? (for consistency)  

I mean, technically all *species* are already guaranteed to fufill requirements, since they go through the adult stage which was constrained with 3 and 4.  So adults have a basal species link. 

One way of doing this is when you recreate your food web, you can temporarily set all the intraspecific links to 0 (so no cannibalism), and then check for the basalsp and connectivity.  This takes care of 3+4.  
- Depending on how strong you want the requirement to be, you might want to also set all the links between any lifestages (even between different fish species!) as 0 -> so that if one species goes extinct you won't be stuck with species that don't lead to basal. Sure, this can still happen with the normal food web, but taking out an entire species will remove several nodes. [I think I might be going crazy here, is this overthinking it or making it overly complicated? I think so.]


##########CONFIRM WHETHER MODEL ALLOWS LOOPS##########
- Re-read papers (because each species prey is centered at c, and c is assigned a value in [r/2,n])
- This means that each species can eat prey larger than it!
- This also implies cannibalism (that sentence in Williams and Martinez 2000 Nature "Computational considerations require that chains with loops be ignored" is *really* confusing me right now, I probably took it out of context or don't understand it *at all*.)
- Also, it looks like species eat *every* prey that fall in their range [c-r/2,c+r/2].  So no randomness. 


##########TIME SCALES##########
- Check what time scale the ODE uses.
- Might want to consider using two different timescales:  One for plankton and one for fish.
	- Use to test sensitivity 


##########CANNIBALISM##########
- Run the same model twice, one with no cannibalism, and one where cannibalism is allowed at a parameterized rate
- Maybe guarantee that lifestages will eat previous life stages?


##########ANALYSIS##########
- Time series analysis of lotka volterra relationship
- (Body mass ratio & longevity) correlations with oscillations in life stages (so do longer lived species have more or less oscillations?  Same with longevity)
- Is fish stability and production associated with ecosystem type (ex: autotroph production, variance in autotroph species).
- Are there dominant fish species in the model (in terms of biomass)?  Is it associated with ecosystem type?
- For fishing scenario - decrease metabolic rates and increase prob of maturing  (and for global warming)


##########FUTURE WORK (MAYBE)##########
- Alternative life history strategies _within_ a species (ex:  Mature salmon parr)
