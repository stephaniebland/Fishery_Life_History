##########INTRODUCTION##########
Goal:	Incorporate life history into a general aquatic food web model.
Method:	Add more nodes to the model that represent new life stages for the fish species.


##########TROPHIC LEVELS##########
- Calculate trophic levels again after you run the simulation (and have necessary biomasses and preferential diets)  This is useful for comparing it to fishbase or "real fish".
- Trophic level is calculated as average of shortest path to basalsp and weighted diet, *this is intentional!*  Turns out that it gives a very accurate estimate of actual trophic level, better than either combined.  See:
